# WatchmenCLI Enterprise — private, token-gated Homebrew formula.
#
# The enterprise binary is PRIVATE: it is never published to a public registry and no
# binary bytes live in this tap. Installation authenticates the customer's subscription
# against the cloud license check, which hands back a short-lived presigned download.
#
#   WM_TOKEN=<your-download-token> brew install trywatchmen/tap/wm-enterprise

# Mint a download token in your dashboard: Tokens -> Enterprise download token.

# Fetches the private binary through the cloud license check: the customer's WM_TOKEN is
# presented as a Bearer header so the server authenticates the subscription, then 302-
# redirects to a short-lived presigned S3 object. Homebrew strips the Authorization header
# on the cross-host redirect, so the token never reaches storage; Homebrew then verifies
# the sha256 declared below.
